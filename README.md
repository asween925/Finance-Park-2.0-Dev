# Finance Park 2.0
Finance Park 2.0 is an educational tool used by Pinellas County Schools designed to teach students how to better understand their finances. It is a website used by all of PCSB and owned and operated by the Gus A Stavros Institute. 
It is currently in Alpha stage. 
Created by Austin Sweeney.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, and SQL Server with .NET Framework.

I officially started this project on January 2024 after holiday break. The idea behind this project was to replace our current Finance Park system and simulation with something in house. I had already helmed work on a similar project for a different part of the Stavros Institute, called Enterprise Village 2.0 (a similar educational tool/system we use for all of PCSB, but with a younger student base and the structure is different), so I was excited to lead a big project like that again. Finance Park is currently used with an application called FileMaker Pro to handle the backend stuff, and the front-end (AKA the simulation) is handled by a third-party we no longer work with called Junior Achievement. The goal behind FP 2.0 is to have complete control over both the front end and back end experience of Finance Park so that we can make any updates or improvements without having to rely on third-parties for permission or input.

Finance Park 2.0 is all being developed by myself. I had some assistance from our networking team in getting the initial server up, but the majority of the work, both the front-end and back-end, is all created by just me. Working on Enterprise Village 2.0 (EV 2.0) taught me a lot about front-end and back-end development, as I was also by myself for the majority of that project. I gained a lot of confidence and knowledge to the point where I felt comfortable starting Finance Park 2.0 from scratch. My work on EV 2.0 and FP 2.0 are my proudest professional achievements, especially so because I initially joined the Stavros Institute with very basic knowledge of front-end and back-end development. I was hired to be a Technology Technician, but my employers asked me if I would be comfortable with this project, to which I said yes, even though I knew it would be a great undertaking.

With EV 2.0, I used VB for the back-end stuff. As I gained more knowledge in back-end development, I found that C# was a much more common language to use so when I started FP 2.0, I wanted to branch out and use that language instead, so I could broaden my knowledge.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
